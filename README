These are plugins for the modnlp corpus browser; see

https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/

If you have downloaded of cloned the git repo for modnlp, you will
probably want to uncompress this archive (or clone its git repo) into 
modnlp/plugin (in the modnlp directory tree you have downloaded).

If not, you will need to get the 3rd-party libraries from 

https://datasync.ed.ac.uk/index.php/s/AoVdNhjhrSaIWx5

(password: modnlp)

and uncompreee it into the lib/ directory of this pluglin/ tree. 

Theese plugins should be regarded as experimental, beta-level code.

If you still want to use them, you could try

Mosaic/  :  the concordance mosaic visualisation 

ConcTree/ : A concordance tree

and the (somewhat silly)

WordleConc/ : which illustrates how plugins that use processing.org
              libraries can be created.
