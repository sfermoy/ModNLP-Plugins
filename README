These are plugins for the modnlp corpus browser; see

https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/

They should be regarded as experimental, beta-level code.

If you still want to use them, you could try

Mosaic/  :  the concordance mosaic visualisation 

and the (somewhat silly)

WordleConc/ : which illustrates how plugins that use processing.org
              libraries can be created.
