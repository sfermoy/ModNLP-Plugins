These are plugins for the modnlp corpus browser; see

https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/

If you have downloaded of cloned the git repo for modnlp, you will
probably want to uncompress this archive (or clone its git repo) into 
modnlp/teccli (in the modnlp directory tree you have downloaded) with
name org-modnlp/, by doing this, for instance:

git clone ssh://luzs@git.code.sf.net/p/modnlp/plugins/code org-modnlp

You will also need to get the 3rd-party libraries from:

https://datasync.ed.ac.uk/index.php/s/AoVdNhjhrSaIWx5

(password: modnlp)

and uncompress it into the 3rdpartylib/ directory of this pluglin/ tree. 

If you have not cloned the plugin repo into and existing modnlp/ tree,
you will also need to obtain the latest versions of idx.jar and
teccli.jar, and place them into the 3rdpartylib/ directory.

Theese plugins should be regarded as experimental, beta-level code.

If you still want to use them, you could try

Mosaic/  :  the concordance mosaic visualisation 

ConcTree/ : A concordance tree

and the (somewhat silly)

WordleConc/ : which illustrates how plugins that use processing.org
              libraries can be created.
